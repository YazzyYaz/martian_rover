# Martian Rover Design

## Author: Yaz Khoury

This repository is for the design and test of a Martian Rover to be used
in the Mars Ice House concept for the NASA 3D-Printed Habitat Challenge.

Mars Ice House won First Place in the competition.

The following screenshot shows what the Mars Ice House looks like:

As you can see, the structure is made out of Ice.

The proposed robot design we are working on is shown in the following
screenshot:

This repository will contain electronic schematics and control systems code
that is going to be used to build the robot.

For now, since we are in the testing stage of 3D Printing Ice, we are just
performing tests on the motors to control the flow of ice-cold water used
for 3D-Printing. Later on, we will build upon this project.
